# Course Management System

This project is a Datalagring(.NET & database) course assignment.

This assignment focuses on building an application with database management and backend development in C# including a frontend connected to the API.

## Project Description
This system is a full-stack web application for managing students using ASP.NET Core Minimal API, React and SQL Server. 
The database is designed using ERD(crow's foot notation), normalization principles (1–3NF) and includes integration testing with xUnit and SQLite in-memory database.


## Technologies
### Backend
- ASP.NET Core Minimal API
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server

### Frontend
- React
- Vite
- JavaScript
- CSS

### Testing
- xUnit
- WebApplicationFactory
- SQLite In-Memory

### Tools
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio
- Visual Studio Code
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

The project focuses primarily on backend functionality and database integration. 
While full CRUD functionality is implemented in the API, 
the frontend currently supports viewing and creating students. 
Extending full CRUD support in the UI is planned as future work.
